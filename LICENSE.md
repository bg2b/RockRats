Licensing
=========

Different parts of Rock Rats are made available with different
permissions.

Source Code
-----------

The actual game source code files (all the `.swift` files in the
repository) were written by Daniel Long and David Long and are
licensed under the MIT license. You have permission to make copies of
the files, alter them, use them in your own projects, and even make
money from those projects. But you have to reproduce the copyright
notice below, and if there are problems that result from your use of
the code, then it's not our fault.

Game Assets
-----------

Almost all of the game assets in the repository (basically the
graphics, sound, and font files) were developed by
[Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl) and are in the public domain. A few
assets are from other public domain sources, and a few were created by
or altered by us; these are also in the public domain. Public domain
assets can be used with no restrictions. However, we have donated to
support Kenney and the work he does for independent game
developers. If you find his assets useful for your projects, we
encourage you to do the same.
