Licensing
=========

Rock Rats is built of many parts, and different parts have different
permissions.

Source Code
-----------

The actual game source code (that's all the `.swift` files in the
repository) was written by Daniel and David Long and can be used and
redistributed under the MIT license. This license gives you permission
to make copies of those files, alter them, use them in your own
projects, and even make money from those projects, but if there are
problems that result from your use of the code, then it's not our
fault. See below for the legal terms.

Game Assets
-----------

Almost all of the game assets in the repository (basically the
graphics and sound files) were developed by
[Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl) and are in the public domain. A few
assets are from other public domain sources, and a few were created by
or altered by us; these are also in the public domain. Public domain
assets can be used with no restrictions.  However, we have donated to
support Kenney and the work he does for independent game
developers. If you find his assets useful for your projects, we
encourage you to do the same.
