// MARK: Stuff for u_time

// Notes about u_time and shaders...
//
// It seems that u_time is zero when it first gets used in some shader.  All well and
// good.  When I write an effect like the hyperspace shaders, they'll do some sort of
// warping over time.  For example, going into hyperspace has the sprite unwarped at
// u_time = 0 and then start twisting as u_time increases.
//
// The problem is that when I use the shader a second time, u_time doesn't go back to
// zero.  It's like a clock that started with the first shader use, and it just keeps
// running in the background.
//
// Worse, it applies to all shaders, not just ones that I want to reuse.  So I can't
// simply create a shader that wants u_time = 0, use it, and then throw it away.
//
// What I can do is learn the offset between u_time and the time passed to update(_:
// TimeInterval).  The first time that a shader gets used (when u_time is guaranteed
// to be 0), I can save the offset.  After that, when I need to invoke a shader that
// would want u_time = 0, I instead refer to u_time - offset.  The offset can be
// passed in by a shader attribute.  That's the whole a_start_time business.
//
// The one wrinkle is that it seems that it's somehow possible for there to be a
// drift between u_time and the time passed to update().  How I don't know, but I had
// at least one occasion where I had quit the app (gone to the iPad home screen) and
// then come back to it a couple of days later.  When I did, the shader effects that
// relied on u_time - offset = 0 were screwed up.  So I needed to come up with a way
// to get whatever u_time the shaders were using.  That's done with the utimeShader
// stuff.
//
// utimeShader is a shader that encodes u_time in the three components of a pixel
// color.  I need fractions of a second, so I multiply u_time by 128 (iPad Pro
// refresh is 120 Hz) and then peel off 24 bits of precision to store in R, G, and B.
// To get that color out, I use SKView's texture(from: SKnode) method.  I take a tiny
// sprite (a 2x2 square, but 1x1 might be OK too) and then render that into a
// texture.  The texture is converted into a pixel array with the TextureBitmap
// struct.  Then readUtime takes the first pixel and reverses the encoding process to
// get the u_time that the utimeShader saw.  I reset the saved utimeOffset each time
// I do a scene transition or when the app becomes active.  The update(_:
// TimeInterval) in BasicScene calls getUtimeOffset each time through; that will do
// readUtime once and then cache the value of the offset.
