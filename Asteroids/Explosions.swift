// We have a texture that is the full thing that's supposed to explode, like a
// spaceship or whatever.  We'll cut it up into an explosionSplits * explosionSplits
// grid.  Each part will become a separate sprite with its own physics.  We place
// them in a grid arrangement so that together they initially look like the object
// that's exploding.  Add in some random velocity dispersion plus the exploding
// object's velocity so that they fly apart realistically.  The physics bodies are a
// separate class so they mostly just collide among themselves, though we do let them
// bounce off asteroids too.
