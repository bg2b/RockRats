// We have a texture that is the full thing that's supposed to explode, like a
// spaceship or whatever.  We're going to make an emitter node whose particles have
// this texture.  We want it to look like the thing is flying to pieces.  So we
// conceptually chop the full texture up into a grid of pieces.  Each piece will be
// scaled down so that it is about the right size for a piece of the full texture.
// Now the tricky part: we have to arrange so that each particle only draws some
// random bit of the full texture.  What we do is have the emitter assign each
// particle a random "color".  A custom fragment shader will use this color to figure
// out which part of the full texture to render.

// The texture will be chopped into an explosionSplits * explosionSplits grid.  Max
// is 16 so that a single random color component (8 bits) can index a single piece in
// the grid.
let explosionSplits = 8

// Here's the actual shader code.  We get the grid index from v_color_mix.r which
// will be randomly initialized by the emitter for each individual particle.
