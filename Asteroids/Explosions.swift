// I have a texture that is the full thing that's supposed to explode, like a
// spaceship or whatever.  I'll cut it up into smaller rectangles.  Each part will
// become a separate sprite with its own physics.  I place the parts in an
// arrangement so that together they initially look like the object that's exploding.
// Add in some random velocity dispersion plus the exploding object's velocity so
// that they fly apart realistically.  The physics bodies are a separate class so I
// can have them just collide among themselves, though I currently have them set to
// bounce off asteroids and ships too.

/// Create the rectangles for an explosion
///
/// Call with the initial rectangle `CGRect(origin: .zero, size: texture.size())`.
/// The rectangle is split recursively in a somewhat random manner, though the pieces
/// are constrained in aspect ratio and the final sizes won't vary too much.
///
/// The final array contains disjoint rectangles whose union is the initial
/// rectangle.

///   - rect: The piece of the texture that's being cut up
///   - wantedSize: Approximately how small to make the pieces

/// An explosion
///
/// This is basically an array of tiny sprite nodes along with displacements telling
/// how to arrange them so that they initially look like the original texture.
/// They're given an initial velocity to make them expand outward while still moving
/// approximately in the direction of the original sprite.
///
/// There's one wrinkle, an extra node at the end of the array that's responsible for
/// waiting until all the pieces finish fading out and removing themselves from the
/// playfield.  The extra node delays and then puts the whole explosion back in a
/// cache for later reuse.
///
/// - Bug:
/// I can lose an explosion if the player force-quits a game before the recycler
/// node's action gets a chance to run.  It won't break things since the cache will
/// make a new explosion when required, but it would be nice if the playfield cleanup
/// could recognize the recycler object and trigger its final action immediately in
/// some way, or if there was some other explosion-recycling mechanism.
