  /// to 500-600MB by pausing/unpausing/aborting, and undoubtedly could have gotten
  /// it higher if I were patient.  Also, leak checking showed that the scene was
  /// being collected fine upon end-of-game or aborting a game, so it didn't seem to
  /// have anything to do with something that I was retaining.
  ///
  /// The one I did originally was to render `gameArea` to a texture, run that
  /// explicitly through a `CGImage`, `CIFilter`, `CGImage` `SKTexture` sequence, and
  /// make a sprite with that effect texture above the game area.  It's kind of ugly
  /// and awkward, though it does offer one benefit, in that I could use the regular
  /// scene transition stuff (which requires the scene to be unpaused) during an
  /// abort, and this approach would let it appear as if the game was paused
  /// throughout the transition.  The main drawback of this approach (aside from the
  /// hackish nature) was that there would be a slight lag when pressing the pause
  /// button before the paused texture could be constructed and shown.  (In the case
  /// of the non-retro Gaussian blur filter that I was using, it was possible to
  /// avoid this by rendering `gameArea` at a smaller scale and blurring that.  But
  /// that didn't help the retro case.)
  ///
  /// The second option seems cleaner and is what I've switched to.  That's to use a
  /// shader instead of a CI filter for the effect.  The fact that this avoids the
  /// leak without explicit off-screen rendering and filtering also supports the idea

  // Scene transitions are a bit subtle, but here's the idea.
  //
  // The basic problem is that when the app needs to transition to a new scene, it
  // usually has to create one (the exception is the case of going back to the main
  // menu).  That creation process tends to cause frame lag, even when I run it on a
  // background thread with low priority.  But the transitions I was using initially
  // were just a simple fade-out-then-fade-in.  Then I realized that if I could
  // somehow do the scene construction in the middle of the transition, any lag would
  // be irrelevant since the app would be displaying a static (blank) graphic anyway.
  // That idea led to the current mechanism.
  //
  // Transitions now consist of three parts:
  // 1. Outgoing transition of the current scene
  // 2. Scene creation
  // 3. Incoming transition of the new scene
  //
  // Each phase of a transitions is managed via a sprite node with zPosition at
  // LevelZs.transition.  That's above everything else.  The sprite has a trivial
  // texture which isn't really used for anything, and it has a size and position
  // that covers the whole frame.  The sprite is basically a mask.  In some places it
  // shows the underlying scene, and in others it shows the app's background color.
  // The masking behavior is controlled by the sprite's shader, which determines what
  // to hide and what to show as a function of time.
  //
  // When a scene wants to make a transition, it calls `switchScene(withFade:)`,
  // `switchScene`, or `switchWhenQuiescent` as appropriate.  The main argument is a
  // closure that returns the new scene (typically after creating it).  The first
  // function is used only on paused scenes (when aborting a game).  Because the
  // scene is paused, the display is already static.  The latter two functions make
  // an outgoing transition that installs a masking transition sprite in the current
  // scene and sets its shader to `BasicScene.exitShader`.  The sprite runs an action
  // to animate the shader.  After the animation finishes, the display is again
  // completely static.  Once the display is frozen, the closure to get the new scene
  // is invoked.
  //
  // The final stage is conceptually just to add a masking transition sprite in the
  // new scene and set its shader to run and reveal the scene.  Since the new scene
  // seems to take a few frames to get going and start updating at a reasonable rate,
  // I first go ahead and add a transition sprite to the new scene.  I set the shader
  // to `maskingShader`, which is just a static shader that hides the scene.  I also
  // set the masking sprite as the value for `entryTransition` in the new scene.
  // When the new scene starts invoking `update`, one of the steps there is to call
  // `doEntryTransition`.  When that function finds a non-nil `entryTransition`, it
  // starts an action to wait for another few frames and sets `entryTransition` back
  // to `nil`.  That action sets the shader to `BasicScene.entryShader`, which does
  // the entry transition to reveal the scene.  Once the shader finishes, the sprite
  // is removed.
