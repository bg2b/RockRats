// MARK: - Skywriting shader

/// Return a shader that's used for skywriting with a specified pixel texture.
///
/// Details of how this works are documented in the shader source.  To draw the
/// character there's a `skywritingGridWidth` = 7 column by `skywritingGridHeight` =
/// 9 row pixel grid.  That's 7 * 9 = 63 bits to specify a character.  Those 63 bits
/// are given by specifying a vec3 attribute `a_bits`, with 21 bits for each of the
/// vec3's x, y, and z.  The bits correspond to the pixels (on or off), and the
/// ordering of the bits is by rows, lsb-to-msb, left-to-right in a row and then
/// top-to-bottom among rows.  So the single top-left pixel set is `vec3(1, 0, 0)`
/// and the single bottom-right pixel would be `vec3(0, 0, 1<<20)`.  (This sort of
/// thing is why the grid height and width can't be arbitrarily adjusted).
///
/// It's also convenient if the sprite can have a width that's not fixed at
/// `skywritingGridWidth` columns, so there's a second attribute, the float
/// `a_width`.  The integer part of that is the number of columns.  Since there's
/// some extra info available in that float, I also use the fractional part as an
/// offset of u_time for wiggling.  Because the width varies, it's best to set the
/// sprite's anchor point is (0, ...) so that the left edge of the matrix aligns with
/// the character sprite's position.
///
/// To actually make a character, make a sprite that has the pixel as its texture and
/// has size:
///
/// `skywritingGridSpacing * texture.size() * (columns, skywritingGridHeight)`.
///
/// The grid spacing is to allow the pixel some room to wiggle inside the matrix of
/// the character.  Make the anchor point `(0, ...)`.  Set the sprite's shader, and
/// set the `a_bits` attribute according to the bit pattern of the character.  Set
/// `a_width` to `columns` (plus a random fractional part between 0 and 1 if
/// desired).
///
/// The shader depends on the pixel texture if the texture happens to be part of an
/// atlas.  The same shader can be used for all pixel textures if they're not in an
/// atlas.
