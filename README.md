# Rock Rats #

This is a joint project with [Footkick72](https://github.com/Footkick72), our first iOS
game, released on the App Store as [Rock Rats](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1481795281).

If you're as old as I am, you might remember when this first appeared:

Graphics have come a fair way since this was state-of-the-art:

But my memories of dropping _waaaaay_ too many quarters into one of these machines and
flying around imagining that I was Duck Dodgers are lovely.  They inspired this homage
to a classic arcade game from my youth.
