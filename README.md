# Rock Rats

## Updates for version 1.2.0

- Selectable starting wave for faster-paced games
\
If the starting wave is cleared, there's a bonus that makes scores are comparable with
starting from wave 1.  However, you get at most one extra life while skipping.
- Official game controller support
\
Rock Rats uses the standard iOS controller support now, so remapping of controls can
be done from settings
- Haptics support (on iPhone or via a game controller)
- Weekly and daily recurring leaderboards
- A few new achievements
- Play area limited to at most 3:2 aspect ratio
\
This makes scores more comparable between iPad and iPhone
- Updates for iOS 15+, removal of dependence on deprecated functionality
- A few minor tweaks and bug fixes

## Description

This is a joint project with [Footkick72](https://github.com/Footkick72), our first iOS
game, released on the App Store as [Rock Rats](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1481795281).
Here's some game footage on YouTube:

If you're as old as I am, you might remember when this first appeared:

Graphics have come a fair way since this was state-of-the-art:

But my memories of dropping _waaaaay_ too many quarters into one of these machines and
flying around imagining that I was Duck Dodgers are lovely.  They inspired this homage
to a classic arcade game from my youth.
